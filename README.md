# TFG_ADDS
Trabajo Fin de Grado Transformación digital y nube hibrida de la Diputación Provincial de Guadalajara. UNIR/2021

This is a project in order to resume and to organize the tasks we must do when we need to deploy an AD DS service since the beginning.
This repository will contain all model documents that we have used in our project. The most of them are inside the chapter “Designing the Active Directory Logical Structure” of the Designing and Deploying Directory and Security Services de Microsoft book.
Of course, the documents you can find in this repository are customazed to our particular project. If you want to get the original, you can get them from: https://docs.microsoft.com/es-es/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/active-directory-domain-services

Regards. Carlos.
